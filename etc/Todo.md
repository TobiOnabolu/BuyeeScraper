# TODO
Correctly filter price

Handle processing and dropping of data in pipeline

Check if we can collect the id of products so we dont collect twice and can continously append to. should be dropped in items before call to translate pipeline


Rotate proxies https://www.reddit.com/r/scrapy/comments/xw15vg/403_response_in_ide_but_can_still_visit_url_in/

Rotate headers 

Add efficient pagination so im not making multiple requests

 Make diff spiders for diff stores but start url should have multiple if same store but diff genders

## Concerns

Too much calls to google translate api

Cleaning of price may fail if they give different currency based on location
